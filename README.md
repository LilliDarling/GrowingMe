# Growing Me - Personal & Professional Blog Site

## About  

This project was created with the initial design and idea coming a few years before actually becoming a 
Software Engineer. I wanted to create a project that would not only showcase my design abilities, but also 
be something I could use to learn software engineering. It wasn't until taking an intensive program (yes a 
bootcamp), that I was able to grow a foundation and actually do something with this project. 

I chose to use a NoSQL database over a SQL database due to the ability to adjust my articles with varying options 
instead of having to stick to a specific layout. I decided to use FastAPI since it is one of the more recent technologies 
and designed to not only scale well but also work asynchronously, allowing for a better performance and easier 
testing. 

### Tech Stack  

- FastAPI
- MongoDB
- React Native

### Other Technologies & Libraries

- ODMantic
- Motor
- Docker
- React Native Web

### Documentation

- [API](https://github.com/LilliDarling/GrowingMe/blob/main/api/README.md)
- [APP](https://github.com/LilliDarling/GrowingMe/blob/main/app/README.md)

## Intended Market

The app is designed for me to create articles based on various factors that lead into being a Software Engineer. I 
wanted a platform that I could share information relating to working as a female in STEM, working with ADHD/AuDHD, 
and any other tips and tricks that I wish I had known years ago when I first started all the way through what I currently 
am learning. Through this app, I hope to lead others to find their own inspiration to achieve their ultimate career goals 
and learn to fall in love with it along the way.
