## The Beginning

Every great journey starts with a single step — or in my case, a single seed. When I first embarked on my career in software engineering, I had no idea where it would take me. All I knew was that I had a passion for building things and an insatiable curiosity about how technology works.

## Finding My Path

Navigating the tech industry as a woman hasn't always been easy. There were moments of doubt, imposter syndrome, and the constant feeling of having to prove myself. But through it all, I've learned that these challenges are what make the journey worthwhile.

## Growing Through Challenges

Working with ADHD has been both a challenge and a superpower. The hyperfocus that comes with it has allowed me to dive deep into problems and come up with creative solutions that others might not see. Learning to harness this energy rather than fight it has been one of the most important lessons of my career.
