## Understanding ADHD in the Workplace

ADHD isn't just about being distracted — it's a different way of processing the world. In the tech industry, this can actually be an incredible asset when properly understood and managed.

> "ADHD is not about knowing what to do, but about doing what you know." — Dr. Russell Barkley

## My Strategies

Over the years, I've developed strategies that work for me. From time-blocking to body-doubling, finding the right tools has been a game-changer.

## The Superpower Side

Hyperfocus, creative problem-solving, and thinking outside the box — these are just a few of the strengths that come with ADHD. Learning to harness these abilities has transformed my career.
