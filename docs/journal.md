# Journal 

## How to read this

This will be a log of each day at the end of the day to see any progress made in learning, find
any pain points that I need to work on, celebrate the victories, and anything that has to do with
the repo. It is one method that I will use to document this project for future reference as well
as get into the habit of creating well documented work. Nothing in here will be vital to the project
as a contributor or as a forked project.

### 08/15/2024

Today I worked on:

* Configuring dockerfiles for development 
* Setup API skeleton for posts, chapters, & categories
* Created documentation directory with new files and spent some time working on them

Thoughts: Late response.

Bugs: There is a weird bug that I am trying to figure out where if you update a category, it won't show 
the update in the list view. 

Resources: None

### 09/03/2024

Today I worked on:

* Finishing up Category Queries and Routes
* Created tests for all of category

Thoughts: I have a feeling that I am not finished with the Category section, however, for right now everything
is functioning exactly as expected with tests all passing. It is getting easier to learn new technologies and how
to get them to work the way I want them to.

Bugs: No current bugs to report.

Resources: Utilized older projects and the ODMantic documentation.

### 09/04/2024

Today I worked on:

* Creating a CI file for GitHub workflows

Thoughts: I dug into figuring out how to make a CI file specifically for what I am doing. I understood the GitLab
version so was a bit lost at first but after using AI and other GitHub examples, I was able to successfully make a 
CI file that has passing tests for what I have currently done. I just need to make sure I format with black before 
merging into main.

Bugs: No current bugs to report.
