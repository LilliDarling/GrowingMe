# Journal 

## How to read this

This will be a log of each day at the end of the day to see any progress made in learning, find
any pain points that I need to work on, celebrate the victories, and anything that has to do with
the repo. It is one method that I will use to document this project for future reference as well
as get into the habit of creating well documented work. Nothing in here will be vital to the project
as a contributor or as a forked project.

* Configuring dockerfiles for development 
* Setup API skeleton for posts, chapters, & categories
* Created documentation directory with new files and spent some time working on them
