## Contributors

Hey fellow nerd! I appreciate your interest in adding to my project. I know you may have some grand 
ideas, and I would love to hear them, but please stay within the scope of this project. Of course, I 
will be approving or denying any features and pull requests, so please don't flood the repo! If you have
any questions, want to discuss a feature, or might want to collaborate on a future project, please reach 
out to me. I am always down to create more magic!
