# Rules for the project

You can never be too careful which is why some of the rules may be redundant or you 
may have already read them in some of the other files. If you have any questions on 
them, please feel free to reach out. I get this might be a bit much, but again I would
rather be on the safe side.

## Rule 1

You **MUST** talk to me first before trying to create a feature as a contributor.
  - While I appreciate your idea, there is still a scope I would like to stay in
  with this project.
  - I will approve or deny what I wish.
  - If you would like to contribute, please come prepared with a flushed out idea.
  Someone may have already had the same idea, but if yours is more put together, then
  I will go with your feature.
  - Please give me a timeline! Life can get busy, I know, but I would rather like to not
  have a bunch of stale branches and half done features.

## Rule 2
